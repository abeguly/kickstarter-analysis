## Analysis and Challenges
To perform the following analysis we leveraged the Kickstarter dataset that included a listing of historical fundraising projects. Each fundraising project has the information around it's goal and pledged amount, associated country, deadline, category and subcatergory and etc. Considering that Louise's play Fever project falls under a theater category, we decided to narrow down our dataset to historical projects in theater categorry. For a further anakysis, we narrowed down our dataset to play sub-category to see any trends.
